Today is different. For the first time I had nothing in mind when I started writing this.

Luckily I left some clue yesterday. I should talk about Cassendra and her trip to Toronto.

She booked her trip before we got together so when I tried to book tickets it got way too pricey. But I think it's not a bad thing that we get some alone time to process things with ourselves, about life, this relationship and future maybe.

I get to craft my own daily wind down routine to follow and help achieve my goals. And honestly I prefer taking alone time every once in a while, living with another person where I have to think about her all the time can be exhausting.

I started using kijiji and facebook marketplace to sell some of my stuff (shoes and maybe furnitures).

I got nothing worth talking about, so I am going to rant.

Some issues that I face:

1. TODO list, I want a todo list in my face or in my mind every time I get bored. I cannot let my brain decide what to do next.

2. Shopping list: I constantly want to go to the groceries and pick up some forgotten items.

3. what to clean next? this should also be a list to keep track of.
