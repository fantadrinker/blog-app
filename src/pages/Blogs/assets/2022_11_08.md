Took a long break from this, went to Banff for vacation, got back, broke up with Holiday, and started seeing Cassendra with 'e' instead of 'a' like the normal Cassandra (lol). This is probably proof that all girls like to mess with the usual name spellings, but it's interesting.

A little background for her. She was one of the 3 other people that I went to banff/jasper with. Just finished off her Masters' in Nutrition in UBC and looking for a job. Currently volunteering/working at a lab. Went out on a few hikes/movies/dinner dates with her.

Ended up pretty close with her, I would regularly pick her up from her aunt's house to mine and cook dinner and watch movies/shows or study/work together, sleep together and go our own way the next morning.

Time's almost up for today though. Why? because I just set up this routine where I block time off for everyday before bed. 30 mins for journaling, and unfortunately I spent the first 10-15 mins of journaling time flossing/washing face. My bad. But I will pick up the pace tomorrow, I will talk more about her and her trip to Toronto.
