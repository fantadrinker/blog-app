mood: okay

Woke up at 2 am and couldn't sleep until 6. Must have been either the seafood or the drinks that messed up my stomach.

Ended up waking up at 9:30, skipped workout, and bombarded with meetings with super fragmented times to do work, and I was not able to do much work today. Might have to make up for some overtime tomorrow. Hope I get a good sleep today.

Feel like I have more and more free time to work with once I stopped opening up games on my PC/console right after work. Maybe I don't need that much video games in my life. I have yoga daily practices that takes 40-50 mins a day, maybe guitar practices, and grocery shopping and de-cluttering the room. These are all alternatives that can make my life happier than playing video games. Practicing yoga calms my mind, and also improves my mobility to help me play sports pain-free, shopping and cleaning will make the room look cleaner and lightens the mood. And I can also maybe work on my blog app/page. Maybe this weekend I can clean up everything so I don't hate myself when doing chores.

That's it for today, hope tomorrow gets better. Baby steps.
