Weather: Cloudy

Mood: Happy

Today didn't do much. Nicolas was going to come but we got lazy and I need to attend to selling some items on facebook market.

So I tidied up the room a little bit, reorganized the drawer and bought some stuff on amazon.

I need to take a look at my connect for work tomorrow or Sunday.

Cass went to visit UW and had a pretty happy day, much better than yesterday when she had a fight with her girl friend :P.

I luckily sold all 3 items I listed earlier this week on marketplace, so I need to figure out where to put stuff in the living room space again.
