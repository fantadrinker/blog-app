### Blogs


I stubbed my toe so I can't do any physical activities. Apartment is 30 C so I ran to a bubble tea shop with my macbook hoping to do some work. Really want to add something to this blog app but I'm a little stuck.

One option is to set up database and API layer to store and retrieve blogs on an API level, but that would be a lot of work right off the bat.

The other is to store blogs as markdown. Implement rendering first and then flesh out the storage issue/design with API and database stuff.

I think I should take the second option for now.

What next? I always wanted to do a quote+like or quote+email functionality. User selects text, we show a coffee or heart icon pop up, then I can get an email or notification when they click that. After that we show a "thank you" note, maybe even the user can leave a name. Requirements:

- Backend API and DB set up, `/like?quote=<string>`: Adds like entry, returns transaction Id

- Backend API: `/like?quote=<string>&name=<string>&override=<tid>`: when user leaves name/email/comments

Also, I should probably setup blog upload since I'll need backend API + DB with the above feedback feature.

- DB set up:

```
CREATE TABLE Blogs (
    Id guid,
    Title string,
    content plaintext?,
);
```
```
CREATE TABLE UserFeedback (
    Id guid,
    Quote string,
    BlogId Id,
    Note string(?),
);
```


After I got enough feedbacks I can start working with them too.
